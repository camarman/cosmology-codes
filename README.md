# Codes in cosmology

Codes will be uploaded here that are useful to study cosmology. For example the codes will calculate the age of the Universe, compute different distance measures based on the standard model of cosmology. 

We start with a simple code that calculates the age of the Universe based on the best fit parameters obtained using the data from the Planck mission (https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck). 

Here are the contents of each notebook:

1. [Age-of-the-Universe.ipynb](Age-of-the-Universe.ipynb)

   * Friedmann equations
   * Compute the age of the Universe

2. [Ages-Distances-Angles.ipynb](Ages-Distances-Angles.ipynb)

   * Solutions to Friedmann equations
   * Rate of expansion of the Universe
   * Age of the Universe today
   * Age at a particular redshift
   * Comoving radial distance
   * Angular diameter distance 
   * Luminosity Distance
   * Acceleration of the Universe
   
   
3. [Dark-Energy-Density-LCDM-Constraints.ipynb](Dark-Energy-Density-LCDM-Constraints.ipynb)

6. [Inflation-Primordial-Perturbation.ipynb](Inflation-Primordial-Perturbation.ipynb)    
    
    * Horizon problem
    * Solution to horizon problem -- Inflation 
    * Solving Klein-Gordon equation
    * Solving Mukhanov-Sasaki/Curvature perturbation equations
    * Solving the tensor perturbation equation
    * Primordial scalar and tensor power spectra
    * Comparison with slow roll approximation

   

**Added mini-codes directory**
 
  * Contents

  1. [Fitting-FIRAS-data.ipynb](Fitting-FIRAS-data.ipynb)
  
    * Fitting FIRAS CMB spectrum (monopole)
    * Constraining spectral distortions from monopole
    
More notebooks will be added. For solutions to primordial perturbations in the inflationary epoch, you can download the fortran code BINGO: https://github.com/dkhaz/bingo (although Inflation-Primordial-Perturbation.ipynb is useful to study and teach, for parameter estimation use of Fortran version is recommended as it is faster).
